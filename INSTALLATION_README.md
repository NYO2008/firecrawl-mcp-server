# Firecrawl MCP Server Installation

## Overview
The Firecrawl MCP server provides web scraping and crawling capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This server allows you to crawl websites, extract content, and perform web scraping operations using the Firecrawl service.

## Installation Details

## Installation Steps Completed
1. ✅ Created directory structure: `mcp-servers/github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server/`
2. ✅ Cloned repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server.git`
3. ✅ Installed dependencies: `npm install`
